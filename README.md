# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## mockup

This Challenge was a huge struggle at first for me. I slowly was getting the hang of it and couldn't wrap my head around infinate loops. I consilted with a classmate who offered to let me start from scratch and he would walk me through step by step. He tought me well and I definatly have a higher understanding of javascript and how to structure my code in a more readable and nicer fasion. Overall Im glad i struggled this hard because if i had not I wouldnt have this higher level of understanding that I could have had.
